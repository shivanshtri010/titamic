## Description of Code Used

This project involves analyzing and predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. The steps taken in the code are as follows:

1. **Import Libraries**: Essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and several machine learning models from Scikit-learn are imported.

2. **Load and Explore Data**: The Titanic dataset is loaded, and initial exploratory steps like viewing the first and last few records, checking the shape, summary statistics, and data types, and identifying missing values are performed.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: 
   - Missing values in the 'Age' and 'Fare' columns are filled with the mean values.
   - The 'Embarked' and 'Sex' columns are mapped to numerical values.
   - Irrelevant columns like 'PassengerId', 'Name', 'Cabin', and 'Ticket' are dropped.
   - The data types of 'Age' and 'Fare' columns are converted to integers.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Histograms of 'Age' and 'Fare' with respect to survival status are plotted.
   - A count plot of the 'Survived' column is created.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - The data is split into training and testing sets.
   - A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data.
   - Predictions are made on the test data, and the accuracy of the model is printed.
